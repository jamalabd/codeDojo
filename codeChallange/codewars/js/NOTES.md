# Comparing Arrays
Often times when a problems boils down to comparing two arrays I find my self in a situation when I am tempted to check one array from inside the other.

this tends to become very messy and convoluted

better way is to leverage array method .includes()

.filter() is also useful if you need to filter out elements from one array based on the elements in another.
